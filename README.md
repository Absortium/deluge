### About
`Absortium` - is a service which allows to pay for `Ethereum` smart contracts by `BTC`, and later with the `USD`, `EUR`, `RUB`. We are very excited by new technologies, built on blockchain and we believe in the future of it and particulary in `Ethereum` and smart contracts, we want to be part of the future. We love the openness and believe that it is the only way to achieve true security and transparency, so that is why all our sources are publicly available, and you can watch our activity and check all the code we produce.
